1. Custom Resource Design

2. State Management

 -  Use StatefulSets: Use StatefulSets to manage stateful applications, which provide features like:
    -   Ordered deployment: Ensures that pods are deployed in a specific order.
    -   Stable network identities: Provides stable network identities for pods.
 -  Implement Leader Election: Implement leader election mechanisms to ensure that only one instance of your application or resource is active at a time.
 -  Use Persistent Volumes: Use Persistent Volumes (PVs) to store data that needs to be preserved across pod restarts or deletions.
 -  Handle Network Identity: Handle network identity changes, such as when a pod is recreated or its IP address changes.

3. Reconciliation Logic

4. Scale Operations

5. Backup and Recovery

6. Monitoring and Metrics
   - Integrate with Kubernetes-native monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
   - Use structured logging to make debugging and troubleshooting easier.

8. Security Considerations

9. Testing Strategy

10. Upgrade Management
