In **SAP's `component-operator-runtime`**, both **`TransformableHelmGenerator`** and **`HelmGenerator`** are used for deploying Helm charts, but they serve different purposes and have distinct usage scenarios. Here’s a comparison from a **usage and application perspective**:

### **1. `HelmGenerator`**  
- **Purpose**: A basic generator that applies Helm charts **as-is** without additional transformations.  
- **Usage**:  
  - Deploy standard Helm charts without modifications.  
  - Suitable when the Helm chart’s default values and structure are sufficient.  
  - Works directly with Helm’s native templating.
- **Additional structures**:
  - internal/generator/generator.go  
     

- **Example Use Case**:  
  - Deploying a standard open-source Helm chart (e.g., `nginx-ingress`, `cert-manager`) without customization.  

### **2. `TransformableHelmGenerator`**  
- **Purpose**: Extends `HelmGenerator` with **additional transformation capabilities** before applying the Helm chart.  
- **Usage**:  
  - Allows **modifying Helm manifests** (e.g., adding labels, annotations, or adjusting resources) before deployment.  
  - Useful when Helm charts need **post-rendering adjustments** (e.g., for SAP-specific requirements).  
  - Can integrate with **Kustomize-like patching** or other transformations.  
- **Additional structures**:
  - parameters.yaml
  - binding.yaml
  - internal/transformer/object_transformer.go
  
- **Example Use Case**:  
  - Deploying a Helm chart but needing to inject specific security policies.  
  - Adjusting resource limits based on environment (dev vs. prod).  

### **Key Differences**  
| Feature                | `HelmGenerator` | `TransformableHelmGenerator` |  
|------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------|  
| **Modification Support** | No (raw Helm)  | Yes (post-render transforms) |  
| **Customization**       | Limited        | High (via transformations)   |  
| **Use Case**           | Standard Helm deployments | Advanced deployments requiring adjustments |  
| **Complexity**         | Low            | Higher (due to transformations) |  

### **When to Use Which?**  
- Use **`HelmGenerator`** if you just need to deploy a Helm chart without changes.  
- Use **`TransformableHelmGenerator`** if you need to **modify the Helm output** before applying it (e.g., SAP-specific compliance, multi-tenant adjustments).
