## Informers and Caching	
Introduced **informers** and **shared informer factories** for efficient resource watching.

## Dynamic Client	
Added support for unstructured data and custom resources.

## Code Generation	
Introduced tools for generating clients and informers for custom resources.

## Testing Utilities	
Added fake clients and testing utilities.

## Context Support	
Integrated context.Context for better cancellation and timeout handling.

## Operator Pattern	
Became the foundation for building Kubernetes operators.

Sample of using client-go (Type-Safe Client)
```go
clientset, err := kubernetes.NewForConfig(config)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

pods, err := clientset.CoreV1().Pods("default").List(context.TODO(), metav1.ListOptions{})
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

for _, pod := range pods.Items {
    fmt.Println(pod.Name)
}
```
