Typed Client vs. Untyped Client (Dynamic Client)
- Typed client is Type safe and has more readability
- The typed clients are generated automatically from the tools like k8s.io/code-generator
- Typed Client: Works with strongly-typed objects. You need to know the resource type at compile time.
- Typed clients provide methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) resources. 
- Dynamic Client: Works with unstructured data (map[string]interface{}). It is more flexible and can work with any resource type, but you lose type safety and compile-time checks.
- Example of using a typed client
```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "path/filepath"

    metav1 "k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1"
    "k8s.io/client-go/kubernetes"
    "k8s.io/client-go/tools/clientcmd"
    "k8s.io/client-go/util/homedir"
)

func main() {
    // Load kubeconfig file
    kubeconfig := filepath.Join(homedir.HomeDir(), ".kube", "config")
    config, err := clientcmd.BuildConfigFromFlags("", kubeconfig)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Error building kubeconfig: %v", err)
    }

    // Create a typed client
    clientset, err := kubernetes.NewForConfig(config)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Error creating clientset: %v", err)
    }

    // List Pods in the "default" namespace
    pods, err := clientset.CoreV1().Pods("default").List(context.TODO(), metav1.ListOptions{})
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Error listing pods: %v", err)
    }

    // Print Pod names
    for _, pod := range pods.Items {
        fmt.Println(pod.Name)
    }
}
```
- A **typed client** in `client-go` is a client that works with **strongly-typed objects**. This means that the client is aware of the specific Kubernetes resource types (e.g., `Pod`, `Deployment`, `Service`) and their associated Go structs. When you use a typed client, you interact with Kubernetes resources using these predefined structs, which ensures type safety and makes your code easier to understand and maintain.
- Untyped client (e.g., clientset.CoreV1().RESTClient())
- Typed client (e.g., clientset.CoreV1().Pods(namespace).Get(ctx, name, opts))

  
The convention for package structure is `pkg/apis/<group>/<version>`.


Advanced Features of Custom Resources
- Validation           - Enforce constraints on custom resource fields using OpenAPI v3 schema.      
- Defaulting           - Set default values for fields if not provided by the user.                  
- Subresources         - Enable `/status` and `/scale` subresources for advanced use cases.          
- Webhooks             - Implement custom logic for validation, mutation, and conversion.            
- Versioning           - Support multiple versions of a custom resource with conversion between them.
- Finalizers           - Implement custom cleanup logic during resource deletion.                    
- Controllers/Operators- Manage custom resources and reconcile desired state with actual state.

Internal Types and External Types 
- Multiple API Versions(External):	Support API evolution, backward compatibility, and gradual migration.
- Internal Types:	Provide a unified, efficient representation of resources for internal use.
- Conversion Mechanism:	Translate resources between external versions and internal types.


**Multiple API Versions (`v1`, `v1alpha1`, `v1beta1`)**

Kubernetes APIs evolve over time, and new features or changes are introduced in a controlled manner. To manage this evolution, Kubernetes uses **API versioning**. Hereâ€™s why multiple versions are necessary:

**API Evolution and Stability**
- **Stable Versions (`v1`)**: These are production-ready, stable APIs. They are well-tested, backward-compatible, and recommended for use in production environments.
- **Beta Versions (`v1beta1`)**: These APIs are feature-complete but may still undergo changes. They are suitable for testing and experimentation but not guaranteed to be stable.
- **Alpha Versions (`v1alpha1`)**: These APIs are experimental and may change or be removed entirely in future releases. They are not recommended for production use.

By supporting multiple versions, Kubernetes allows users to:
- Use stable APIs for production workloads.
- Experiment with new features in alpha or beta versions.
- Gradually migrate to newer versions as they become stable.

**Backward Compatibility**
- Kubernetes ensures that older API versions remain functional even as new versions are introduced. This allows users to continue using existing tools and configurations without breaking changes.
- For example, if a resource was created using `v1beta1`, it should still be accessible and usable even after `v1` becomes the stable version.

**Gradual Migration**
- Users can migrate their workloads from alpha/beta versions to stable versions at their own pace. Kubernetes provides tools like **API deprecation policies** and **conversion webhooks** to assist with this migration.
